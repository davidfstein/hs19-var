## hackseq19 - TEAM 15: Virtual and Augmented Reality for Single-Cell Data Exploration.*

## Project Description

### Final product website: http://www.singlecellvr.com

### Goal / Vision:
- Visualize high-tech single-cell RNA-seq experiments at a life-size scale in 3-D
- Write software compatible with google cardboard
- Build a web-tool that allows anyone to upload a simple-format csv and visualize their data immediately - our pre-formatting software converts all data into a format acceptable by VR software

### What kind of data and inputs are we exploring?
- We are exploring any single cell data set that has some inherent trajectory. While we are focusing on available scRNA-seq datasets in this implementation, it is extendable to any data that contains trajectory.

### How are we visualizing this?
- We are writing a suite of virtual reality software that is accessible to the user from our website, www.singlecellvr.com.
