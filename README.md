**NOTE**:  VR Headset device required. <a href = 'https://arvr.google.com/cardboard/'>Google Cardboard</a> is currently the primarily supported headset for this data visualization software.

### Directions
**Step 1**: Upload your single cell trajectory data in .csv format - this is the default product of the <a href = 'http://stream.pinellolab.partners.org/'>STREAM</a> web tool. singlecellvr.com converts this data into a format built for the VR visualization space. (*example data pre-loaded in this vignette*).

**Step 2**: Click the link *on your mobile device* to open the VR space and explore your data.

**Step 3**: Interact with your data by using the signature *Google Cardboard*  one-button interface.

## Notes on production and Project Description

### Goal / Vision:
- Visualize high-tech single-cell RNA-seq experiments at a life-size scale in 3-D
- Write software compatible with google cardboard
- Build a web-tool that allows anyone to upload a simple-format csv and visualize their data immediately - our pre-formatting software converts all data into a format acceptable by VR software

### What kind of data and inputs are we exploring?
- We are exploring any single cell data set that has some inherent trajectory. While we are focusing on available scRNA-seq datasets in this implementation, it is extendable to any data that contains trajectory.

### How are we visualizing this?
- We are writing a suite of virtual reality software that is accessible to the user from our website, www.singlecellvr.com.
